Overview
This report provides a detailed overview of the object detection project implemented using Detectron2. It covers the functionalities, components, and dependencies used in the project.

Functionality
Object Detection: The primary functionality of the project is to detect objects within images using the Detectron2 library.

Installation Script: The installation script (installation.sh) automates the installation process by installing required dependencies and setting up Detectron2.

Prediction Model Setup: The prediction_model.py script initializes and configures the prediction model using Detectron2. It sets up the model's configuration, loads pre-trained weights, and configures inference parameters.

Object Detection Script: The main.py script is responsible for performing object detection on images. It downloads images from provided URLs, processes them using the prediction model, and displays the results.

Execution Script: The execution script (run.sh) simplifies the process of running object detection by taking the image URL as input and executing the main script.

Components
Installation Script (installation.sh):

Installs PyYAML, Detectron2, PyTorch, TorchVision, and OpenCV dependencies.
Clones the Detectron2 repository and installs it.
Prediction Model Setup (prediction_model.py):

Initializes a Detectron2 configuration.
Sets model parameters such as score threshold and number of classes.
Loads pre-trained weights for the object detection model.
Object Detection Script (main.py):

Defines functions for detecting objects in images.
Downloads images from provided URLs.
Processes images using the prediction model.
Displays images with bounding boxes around detected objects.
Execution Script (run.sh):

Accepts an image URL as input.
Executes the main script with the provided URL.
Dependencies
PyYAML: Required for reading and writing YAML files.
Detectron2: The primary library used for object detection.
PyTorch: Provides deep learning functionalities, used as a backend for Detectron2.
TorchVision: Used for various computer vision tasks, including image transformations.
OpenCV: Used for image processing and display.
